# Password-Generator

## Description

 A web app that generates random passwords based on criteria the user selects. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The app has a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. Its always nice to be able to quickly generate a random password when needed.

 This project was created to helped me get a grasp on using javascript and using html DOM methods. Within the javascript I've added error handling for cases where the user hits cancel on the prompts, or enters an invalid character.  

## Usage

Select the "Generate Password" button and then answer the questions in each prompt. Then voil√†, a password is generated and display in the text area. Repeat the process to generate another.
